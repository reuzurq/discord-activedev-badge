# Discord "Active Developer Badge" Bot

A simple Discord bot with slash commands.


### Installing
This project requires Node v14.8.0

Clone the project or download the source in ZIP and extract it.
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/reuzurq/discord-activedev-badge.git
```
Open terminal inside `./discord-activedev-badge-master` and install all needed depencies.
```bash
  npm i
```
### Running
If you don't have a bot or bot token, create a new one on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
```bash
  node . botToken [-d]
```
If you want to kill the bot after using it, use `-d` parameter (optional).

After the bot starts, copy the link from the terminal and paste it into the browser to add your bot to your server. Then send the command `/cats` to get a random fact about cats. Remember to use your friend/alt account.
